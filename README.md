    <h3>Descrition</h3>
    Hiii so I'm bizar04 or bizar in short (I'm also bizarthefox or any variant with fox sometimes). So I like programing but I'm not very good at it yet. I hope I will be a programing engineer in the future. I plan on creating some sites and as an user of blender I will probably try to make add-ons for it.
    Soooo uuhh if you're here from one of my programs I hope you will have fun with it, watch some of my content if you want to and have a great day ! :3
